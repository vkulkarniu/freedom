##What is the way to ML town?

Every couple of years a particular technology becomes the most sought after. And it comes with its own ecosystem with all mooc, and ever mushrooming training institutes,online courses being components of ecosystem. But with ML and AI coming into the landscape packaged as Data Science, umpteen number of regular academic institutions are offering number of courses  apart from mooc and training institutes. So why is it different this time around or rather what is different this time?

Most of the people whom I have come across , invariably ask me one question "Vijay, I see ML and Data Science in general is getting a lot of traction and hundreds of people including students, professionals want to learn it and are enrolling themselves to lot of courses. Tell me what is a good way to learn ML or where do I start from?". In my opinion, this question however naive might sound highlights the degree of obfuscation that exists. 


Let me not get into the eternal debate of what is the right way to learn ML or Data Science as such in general because fundamentally I believe _unlearning is the first step towards learning_ and hence it does not make any sense to debate on that. However, what can be discussed is our experiences with the technology and how each one's experience has been while learning.

I however think it is very imperative to learn the fundamental concepts of Mathematics like Linear Algebra, Probablity, Statistics etc. Here's what I followed ( in the order ):

1.	Linear Algebra
2.  Probablility
3.	Statistics
4.  Basics of Calculus ( Univariate Calculus)
5.	Python / R 
6.	Machine Learning Algorithms 

Having said that the next logical question would be the resources. What to read what not to read. Again there can be a number of answers based on the interest of the reader / learner, the level of exposure to the subject one has etc. However here are some of the books / resources that I have referred to :

|  Subject              |Book                          |Author(s)                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Linear Algebra|Introduction to Linear Algebra    |Gilbert Strang           |
|Linear Algebra          |Linear Algebra Done Right  |Sheldon Axler           |
|Probability      |A First Course in Probability |Sheldon Ross|
|Statistics       |Think Stats, Exploratory Data Analysis in Python |Allen B. Downey|
|Python      |Beginning Python|Magnus Lie Hetland|
|Machine Learning      |Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning|David Barber|
|Machine Learning      |Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning|Christopher M. Bishop|
|Machine Learning      |Machine Learning|Tom M. Mitchell|
|Machine Learning      |Python Machine Learning|Sebastian Raschka, Vahid Mirjalili|

**NOTE** ML Books by David Barber, Bishop and Tom Mitchell assume the reader to have undergraduate level of exposure to Mathematics. 

However, there might be and are many other books which might best suit to different kind of audience. In the event of you finding a book which might cater to a larger audience please do inform me by e-mail.
