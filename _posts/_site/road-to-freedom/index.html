<h2 id="road-to-freedom-">Road to Freedom !</h2>
<p>It is not very often that you get to attend a talk by <a href="https://stallman.org/">RMS</a>. One must say he has a persona that can anchor the thoughts of freedom deep in our minds. I have previously mentioned that one is the main reasons for Free Software activity losing its fizz is the fact that most of the people are not able to connect to the freedom aspect of software and how subtly it is connected with the idea of freedom on a philosophical level. 
I happened to attend his talks at <a href="https://www.rvce.edu.in">RVCE</a> Bangalore and IISc Bangalore on 18th and 19th Jan 2019. I was amazed with the way he takes us from the concept of software to idea of freedom in a manner which is so  seamless.
He started his talk with the idea of what software is and what does the word ‘<em>free</em>’ stands for in the context of free software. 
He explained about the four freedoms i.e.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
  <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
  <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom 2).</li>
  <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
</ul>

<p>He then moved on to explain how big corporates operate in a manner which not only overlooks the larceny but also is in an endeavour to make it a norm. He also warned is about the existence of the universal back door to enter any device without the consent ( more often than not) of the user. This in fact reminded me of a particular line if a song Hotel California “ <strong>we are prisoners of our own device</strong>“.He further discussed how we can break free of what he calls as digital handcuffs. 
Now the question that pops up is “<em>what can we do as citizens or netizens or whatever to be free of this?</em>” 
There are various solutions :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get involved in free software activities by joining <a href="https://www.fsf.org">fsf</a> or <a href="https://fsmk.org/">fsmk</a> or <a href="https://fsmi.in">fsmi</a> or <a href="http://fsf.org.in/">fsf india</a></li>
  <li>Contribute to Free Software ( look up for any free software of your choice and start contributing to it.)</li>
  <li>If you are a student then you can work on Free Software as a part of your academic projects and start a GNU/Linux Users Group in college (GLUG)</li>
  <li>If you are not able in get involved into any of the technical activities then the best part is to talk about it , spread awareness. Read <a href="https://abhas.io/after-rms-talk/">this page</a> for more info</li>
</ul>
