## Towards libre hardware

### Thought Process
- history of mankind
- civilizations
- social fabric
- role of collaboration and education in society 
- how important is the freedom aspect of education
- how it lead to FOSS
- Technology embracing history 
- open hardware 
- ML on open hardware

Ever since the civilisations have started flourishing, there has been a constant endeavour to make them self sustainable. Sustainability demands free and fair access to the resources. The unfair gate keeping processes on access to these resources create  strata in the social structure. 

Have you ever wondered what is the most successful entity in the world ? I am sure there are umpteen number of answers considering the varied perspective each one of us have. But if I were to distinguish objectively then, in my opinion **collaboration** should be the one word answer. 
_Collaboration_, is the thread which keeps the social fabric very strong. Having said that, I view society as a large group of individuals who are proportionately dependent on each other. Apart from _collaboration_, _education_, _freedom_(of speech,expression etc.) are the most important threads which make up the social fabric. 

_Education_ in particular, has been of great interest for me for a long time. One of the main purposes of education is to create an egalitarian society and to achieve this education has to be free (free as in freedom).  There has been a lot of emphasis on this aspect of education and lot of activists are spreading awareness on the same.

One can say in all senses that  [RMS](https://stallman.org/) has extended the free / freedom aspect to softwares and has been an ardent activist for more than 3 decades now. And it wouldn't be wrong if I mention, that _collaboration_ has been the key strength of the FSF. I should mention that diversity has been so important and vital to freedom software and that comes from collaboration. More often than not many different ideas influenced by different cultures and walks of life melt in a melting pot due to collaboration and that's the beauty of it.

Without collaboration on such a scale, none of the open source / free software would have been as successful as they are today. the evolution of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is nothing less than a technological and philosophical revolution. 
Technology has to embrace the history if it has to serve its purpose lest we never make any progress. 

Of late, of all the technologies available, Machine Learning (ML) in particular is gaining a lot of traction owing to its very diverse use cases ranging from something as simple as a spam filter to something as complex as trading and life sciences. A lot of progress has been made in the past decade or so. Most, if not all the frameworks are based on open source platforms and I believe FOSS should get its due credit apart from MOOC in the particular case. 

Nonetheless, much of these frameworks still need a *proprietary* hardware. What if we had an open source hardware that supports these frameworks or ML Algorithms and we could build individual ASICs algorithm per se ? I think this marriage between these open source frameworks and the open hardware can beget some truly open platform for ML Algorithm / framework development. 

With ML and AI and pattern recognition piercing into the consumer centric domain such as FMCG , retail etc, the algorithm developed and running on the proprietary hardware could be dangerous as they could invade the consumers' privacy as one does not have full control over the functionalities of the proprietary hardware. 

The question that now arises is that can we come up with an approach where we can use a open source FPGA boards and design algorithm specific ASIC?  Can the philosophy of freedom become a reality in its true sense? Is there a societal will and a political will to make it realise ?
