## Out of comfort zone !

I had been a little out of touch with the local FOSS community for a while because it was getting difficult to manage my offical travels and the FOSS related activity in Bangalore. Somehow, convenience had grappled me while I was toiling to build a career path for me and I realized that when Abhas told me "Vijay, why don't you move out of your comfort zone? what stops you?". Not only he did stop at that but also he motivated me to take my first step out of my comfort zone. I had been using a non-free ecosystem for a brief time and I was badly looking a way out. This means I need to buy a system and then ensure eveything on that is almost free with expceptions to hardware ofcourse and this trivialy meant a substantial investment. Thanks to Abhas that he showed me a wonderful way out. His suggestion was to buy a pre-owned laptop and a fraction of the price of the brand new. This made me very curious and then I dared to take the first step.

He further went on to explain me the choices I have considering the kind of work I do on the laptop. The best option of the lot for me was a Lenovo X230 Thinkpad. The configuration that I got was 16gb RAM , 9 cell Battery and an SSD. While that is good what makes it even better is that Abhas helped me to get rid of the proprietary bios and have coreboot on that. The best part was for a very nominal amount I replaced a proprietary wireless card with a blob-less wireless card which means I could get rid of using proprietary software. To top it all I used Debian 9 as an OS which means I have only free software on my system. 

Let me talk a bit about the performance. I typically use it for 6-8 hours in a row doing some math heavy programming and some browsing and also watch some movies. I havent seen any lag or any performance issues so far. However depending upon the applications you use / run the batter may drain out a bit faster. I haven't had any heating issues so far and given that its light weight and compact it is now much easier for me to carry around everywhere. 

I would seriously suggest anyone who want to get rid of proprietary software to get in touch with [Abhas](http://abhas.io) and leverage his expertise and take your first step towards a very good laptop sans any proprietary software and be a Free Sofware warrior.
