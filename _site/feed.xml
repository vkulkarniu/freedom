&lt;p&gt;Every couple of years a particular technology becomes the most sought after. And it comes with its own ecosystem with all mooc, and ever mushrooming training institutes,online courses being components of ecosystem. But with ML and AI coming into the landscape packaged as Data Science, umpteen number of regular academic institutions are offering number of courses  apart from mooc and training institutes. So why is it different this time around or rather what is different this time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the people whom I have come across , invariably ask me one question “Vijay, I see ML and Data Science in general is getting a lot of traction and hundreds of people including students, professionals want to learn it and are enrolling themselves to lot of courses. Tell me what is a good way to learn ML or where do I start from?”. In my opinion, this question however naive might sound highlights the degree of obfuscation that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me not get into the eternal debate of what is the right way to learn ML or Data Science as such in general because fundamentally I believe &lt;em&gt;unlearning is the first step towards learning&lt;/em&gt; and hence it does not make any sense to debate on that. However, what can be discussed is our experiences with the technology and how each one’s experience has been while learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I however think it is very imperative to learn the fundamental concepts of Mathematics like Linear Algebra, Probablity, Statistics etc. Here’s what I followed ( in the order ):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linear Algebra&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probablility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Statistics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basics of Calculus ( Univariate Calculus)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python / R&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Machine Learning Algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that the next logical question would be the resources. What to read what not to read. Again there can be a number of answers based on the interest of the reader / learner, the level of exposure to the subject one has etc. However here are some of the books / resources that I have referred to :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Subject&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Book&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Linear Algebra&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Introduction to Linear Algebra&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Gilbert Strang&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;Sebastian Raschka, Vahid Mirjalili&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; ML Books by David Barber, Bishop and Tom Mitchell assume the reader to have undergraduate level of exposure to Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there might be and are many other books which might best suit to different kind of audience. In the event of you finding a book which might cater to a larger audience please do inform me by e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not very often that you get to attend a talk by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stallman.org/&quot;&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt;. One must say he has a persona that can anchor the thoughts of freedom deep in our minds. I have previously mentioned that one is the main reasons for Free Software activity losing its fizz is the fact that most of the people are not able to connect to the freedom aspect of software and how subtly it is connected with the idea of freedom on a philosophical level. 
I happened to attend his talks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rvce.edu.in&quot;&gt;RVCE&lt;/a&gt; Bangalore and IISc Bangalore on 18th and 19th Jan 2019. I was amazed with the way he takes us from the concept of software to idea of freedom in a manner which is so  seamless.
He started his talk with the idea of what software is and what does the word ‘&lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;’ stands for in the context of free software. 
He explained about the four freedoms i.e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom 2).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then moved on to explain how big corporates operate in a manner which not only overlooks the larceny but also is in an endeavour to make it a norm. He also warned is about the existence of the universal back door to enter any device without the consent ( more often than not) of the user. This in fact reminded me of a particular line if a song Hotel California “ &lt;strong&gt;we are prisoners of our own device&lt;/strong&gt;“.He further discussed how we can break free of what he calls as digital handcuffs. 
Now the question that pops up is “&lt;em&gt;what can we do as citizens or netizens or whatever to be free of this?&lt;/em&gt;” 
There are various solutions :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get involved in free software activities by joining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org&quot;&gt;fsf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://fsmk.org/&quot;&gt;fsmk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://fsmi.in&quot;&gt;fsmi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://fsf.org.in/&quot;&gt;fsf india&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contribute to Free Software ( look up for any free software of your choice and start contributing to it.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are a student then you can work on Free Software as a part of your academic projects and start a GNU/Linux Users Group in college (GLUG)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are not able in get involved into any of the technical activities then the best part is to talk about it , spread awareness. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://abhas.io/after-rms-talk/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for more info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no greater addiction than that of the freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom, as they say is always cheaper no matter at what cost it comes. Freedom, in my opinion is by far the most abused word and most of the socio-political groups today attack the very social fabric under the seeming innocuous name of &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt;. As much as they might like, the Governments of the world, in their public rhetoric at least, could not be completely oblivious to the ever-growing demands FOSS activists for the freedom [of software].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are diligent enough to embrace the history we can see that the main reason behind most of the revolutions is the freedom , irrespective of what the freedom is attributed to. For any revolution to be successful, it is important for the revolutionaries to create enablers and propagate the value that they are fighting for. They need to ensure that the people are convinced that the battle is worth fighting. And as long as this doesn’t happen the revolution will not gather much steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a recent conversation with some of the well known FOSS activists from my region which included an entrepreneur and an academician the focus slowly shifted to the fact that the FOSS activity is not gaining the expected momentum in-spite of scores of volunteers are working towards the cause. The organisations associated with FOSS are undertaking numerous activities ranging from weekly sessions , creating new GLUGs (GNU / Linux Users Group) in colleagues to bi-annual sessions that cover from installation of any Linux flavour to ML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the observations which all agreed to democratically was that, the focus of the volunteers in the recent past has shifted more towards teaching the technology which is in alignment with FOSS and how to technically contribute to any free software or open source software. A perhaps apocryphal notion has it that learning these technologies make one a geek or helps the student community to land at a better job or one among a plethora of reasons. Not getting into a mode of framing this into good, bad, right, wrong etc. I would like to reiterate that we are digressing from the core issues for which hundreds of thousands of FOSS activists are fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the central dogma of FOSS is all about the freedom , i.e. “Free software is software that gives you the user the freedom to share, study and modify it. We call this free software because the user is free” - FSF. I have to painstakingly mention that this very essence of freedom is not present in most of the students who demonstrate interest in being associated with FOSS organization in their local geographies ( at the very least where I am currently). I believe it is not too late for us to imbibe this value of freedom so that it can drive them towards appreciating free software for what it stands rather than the notion of being looked upon as a geek, causing an aridity in the revolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Why FOSS is not able to hold the fizz?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Towards libre hardware</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/towards-libre-freedom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Towards libre hardware " /><published>2019-01-08T01:18:41+05:30</published><updated>2019-01-08T01:18:41+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/towards-libre-hardware</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/towards-libre-freedom/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;towards-libre-hardware&quot;&gt;Towards libre hardware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thought-process&quot;&gt;Thought Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;history of mankind&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;civilizations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;social fabric&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;role of collaboration and education in society&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how important is the freedom aspect of education&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how it lead to FOSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technology embracing history&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open hardware&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ML on open hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the civilisations have started flourishing, there has been a constant endeavour to make them self sustainable. Sustainability demands free and fair access to the resources. The unfair gate keeping processes on access to these resources create  strata in the social structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what is the most successful entity in the world ? I am sure there are umpteen number of answers considering the varied perspective each one of us have. But if I were to distinguish objectively then, in my opinion &lt;strong&gt;collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; should be the one word answer. 
&lt;em&gt;Collaboration&lt;/em&gt;, is the thread which keeps the social fabric very strong. Having said that, I view society as a large group of individuals who are proportionately dependent on each other. Apart from &lt;em&gt;collaboration&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;education&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt;(of speech,expression etc.) are the most important threads which make up the social fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Education&lt;/em&gt; in particular, has been of great interest for me for a long time. One of the main purposes of education is to create an egalitarian society and to achieve this education has to be free (free as in freedom).  There has been a lot of emphasis on this aspect of education and lot of activists are spreading awareness on the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can say in all senses that  &lt;a href=&quot;https://stallman.org/&quot;&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt; has extended the free / freedom aspect to softwares and has been an ardent activist for more than 3 decades now. And it wouldn’t be wrong if I mention, that &lt;em&gt;collaboration&lt;/em&gt; has been the key strength of the FSF. I should mention that diversity has been so important and vital to freedom software and that comes from collaboration. More often than not many different ideas influenced by different cultures and walks of life melt in a melting pot due to collaboration and that’s the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without collaboration on such a scale, none of the open source / free software would have been as successful as they are today. the evolution of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is nothing less than a technological and philosophical revolution. 
Technology has to embrace the history if it has to serve its purpose lest we never make any progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of late, of all the technologies available, Machine Learning (ML) in particular is gaining a lot of traction owing to its very diverse use cases ranging from something as simple as a spam filter to something as complex as trading and life sciences. A lot of progress has been made in the past decade or so. Most, if not all the frameworks are based on open source platforms and I believe FOSS should get its due credit apart from MOOC in the particular case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, much of these frameworks still need a &lt;em&gt;proprietary&lt;/em&gt; hardware. What if we had an open source hardware that supports these frameworks or ML Algorithms and we could build individual ASICs algorithm per se ? I think this marriage between these open source frameworks and the open hardware can beget some truly open platform for ML Algorithm / framework development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ML and AI and pattern recognition piercing into the consumer centric domain such as FMCG , retail etc, the algorithm developed and running on the proprietary hardware could be dangerous as they could invade the consumers’ privacy as one does not have full control over the functionalities of the proprietary hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question that now arises is that can we come up with an approach where we can use a open source FPGA boards and design algorithm specific ASIC?  Can the philosophy of freedom become a reality in its true sense? Is there a societal will and a political will to make it realise ?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Towards libre hardware</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Deobfuscating Machine Learning</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ml-for-all/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Deobfuscating Machine Learning" /><published>2019-01-08T01:18:41+05:30</published><updated>2019-01-08T01:18:41+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/deobfuscating-machine-learning</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ml-for-all/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;de-obfuscating-machine-learning&quot;&gt;De-obfuscating Machine Learning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One word is too often profaned 
For me to profane it.
One feeling too falsely disdain’d,
For thee to disdain it. 
	&amp;gt;    – &lt;cite&gt;P.B Shelly&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With technology comes more power and with more power comes responsibility. Every technology comes with it’s own subtle terms and conditions and the major one being using it with utmost responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, unfortunately the knowledge one has about a technology has become synonymous with the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jargons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; one can remember and use. The more obfuscation you create, the more knowledgeable you are. It is only unfortunate that we have are institutionalised to such social conditionings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think jargons are by no means the measure of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is not to prove the possession of it rather the implementation. I think it is only apt to quote Miles Kington here :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad.
 –&lt;cite&gt; Miles Kington &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of education should be to create enablers and not subscribers who subscribe to convenience of using jargons. I see excessive use of jargons as an attempt to make the knowledge proprietary and monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not attempting to frame the act of monetizing the knowledge as long as it is not intended to create knowledge parasites out of the learners.  I am starting a series of articles where I will be taking on the mission of de-obfuscating the Machine Learning jargons and give away a very simple explanation of those terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Linear Separability :
&lt;img src=&quot;https://rdcnewscdn.realtor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/LA-traffic-jam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Traffic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you draw a straight line anywhere on the above picture such that it separates the vehicles going in either directions ?
The answer is a simple Yes. Just draw a straight line on road divider  (in most cases where traffic rules are followed) . Hence we say that the vehicles going in either directions are linearly separable.

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you plan kill someone , What would you do ? What weapon would you be using ? Knife , an Iron Rod , Hockey Stick etc etc .. . Now what if you plan to kill a group of people ? May be some guns ? (Just can’t go shooting people with like Max Payne ). Now imagine you plan to subservient the entire population of a country    ! What would you do ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FLn2yZJT8SY/UVvs6f7NvlI/AAAAAAAAAPI/QWL25aaA3bs/s1600/download.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FLn2yZJT8SY/UVvs6f7NvlI/AAAAAAAAAPI/QWL25aaA3bs/s1600/download.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time immemorial right from Mahabharata to the one in present day people have been fighting for power. So many battles have been fought , so many people have been killed. Although it took a while, people understood that nothing can be gained that way.Greed is the driving force behind all these ; greed of Duryodhana to the greed of wealth that lead to war of Constantinople to the greed of the nations that colonized others , it’s always been greed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent advances in technology and other industries like manufacturing,  telecom, bio-technology etc. name it whatever you want and the changes in the economic policies of almost nations , the interdependence of one nation over the other has increased. No one nation can say to hell with you to other unless they are dang sure that they are self sufficient though this being a distant dream to any country today.All this is true but the greed still exists , it has increased evermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the prevailing geo-political and the economic conditions, the best way to bring down a nation no matter how big or small is to target its economy. Trust me economy today is as good as a religion (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vijaykulkarni.me/2013/03/26/is-economy-the-new-religion.html&quot;&gt;see my previous post on this&lt;/a&gt;). Once you destroy this religion (read as economy) , that’s it !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just imagine you badly need some money so that you can come out of the mess and when the guy who you think can bail you out gives you money on a condition that you gotta spend the money just as the guy says then what is the use of such a loan or bailout?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hx5k2NhLqtg/UVvtdyOuVYI/AAAAAAAAAPY/Yh_IfvEzCL0/s1600/images.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hx5k2NhLqtg/UVvtdyOuVYI/AAAAAAAAAPY/Yh_IfvEzCL0/s1600/images.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LN-oKBTTdHs/UVvtYaX1CeI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/aQGHq_pLOEw/s1600/eco+war.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LN-oKBTTdHs/UVvtYaX1CeI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/aQGHq_pLOEw/s1600/eco+war.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the IMF and WB precisely doing with the countries that have recently joined the Industrial revolution or got freedom recently. How long do they need to dance to the tunes of the so called GOD (read as IMF / WB) ? Enough is enough and thats what the BRIC now BRICS has though and come up with an agenda. BRICS (Brazil , Russia , India , China , South Africa) though have almost nothing in common at all expect from having a sense of being ostracised from the International economic framework. This agenda is the establishment of a New Development Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jOrlkaZSWM4/UVvtllkznMI/AAAAAAAAAPg/TnuVfjnbvik/s1600/brics-cartoon_2219937b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jOrlkaZSWM4/UVvtllkznMI/AAAAAAAAAPg/TnuVfjnbvik/s320/brics-cartoon_2219937b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funds of these 5 countries makeup for almost 25% of world’s GDP! To establish such a Bank is surely an Herculean task given their problems in dealing with it’s own group members.China shares territorial borders with India and Russia. We all know that in the recent past they have been engaged in a war also! Also China is opposing India’s nuclear plans of late. Recently there has been a trade gap between China and India. Russia has its own internals problems in dealing with the US friendly neighbors. On the other hand Brazil is very vigilant when its comes to Argentina. Despite these unfavorable circumstances , these nations have come together for a common goal, the development of the developing economies !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I_a3LV6Ct9k/UVvtpuuH0eI/AAAAAAAAAPo/puG1IesgzyY/s1600/LegionMedia-brics-468.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I_a3LV6Ct9k/UVvtpuuH0eI/AAAAAAAAAPo/puG1IesgzyY/s320/LegionMedia-brics-468.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are few important questions for which they need to find the answers. Here are a few of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can they come out of US hegemony ?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are they sure that this new Bank is not going to repeat what IMF and WB did?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can they ensure that the regional politics and regional issues not going to impact on the function of the Bank?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You think this is going to nail the GOD’s coffin?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How efficiently they can challenge the Western Liberal Democracies (so called) ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all these BRICS indeed is a force that is going to drive the developing economies to excel and come out of the mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the big bang has ever happened, if there is one thing that has stood the test of time; in my personal opinion ; it is Religion. Yes, it needs no proof to prove this, just look back at the history. Be it any religion for that matter. One may say that there are so many religions that have perished. Agreed. But if you look at it and just introspect and ask yourselves what made it perish? It’s again another religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Xk6iFK71bG0/UVE8sLBl5KI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/9asGnBkXbwA/s1600/economy.jpg&quot;&gt;	&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Xk6iFK71bG0/UVE8sLBl5KI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/9asGnBkXbwA/s1600/economy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What basically constitute a religion? It’s nothing but an organized collection of belief system. Any economy is basically the same. It’s nothing but the sheer faith / belief of people in the economy that runs it. Some people have faith in Keynesian economics, where as the other have faith in Freemen Economic theory. There are however who have faith in Communism. It is very much debatable so as to which is better and I will tell you it’s not going to end. Let’s consider dollar it’s the sheer faith in the dollar that has made it the benchmark currency for any trade. As Indians also we are too much worried about the dollar and rupee comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the belief the eurozone countries have in Euro and the rest of the world in Dollar. The governments of the developing countries have sheer faith in the IMF and World Bank and thus act as per their terms. After the rejection of the initial plan for the bailout, the Cypriot government finally came out with another plan to recover from the financial crisis. This plan involved levy on the depositors. So it’s not just that you say abra ka dabra! And you get money. You cannot just create money out of thin air!. If there is something that can create money then it is only &lt;strong&gt;debt&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is observable that how a devotee doesn’t want to hurt his / her god, similarly the governments don’t want to hurt their god (the investors) even though it hurts its population. It’s faith in the consumerism that fetches the major chunk of GDP to some governments and faith in their economy that even though the debt to GDP ratio is over a hundred percent they are able to sustain that.&lt;/p&gt;
