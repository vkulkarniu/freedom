<blockquote>
  <p>There is no greater addiction than that of the freedom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freedom, as they say is always cheaper no matter at what cost it comes. Freedom, in my opinion is by far the most abused word and most of the socio-political groups today attack the very social fabric under the seeming innocuous name of <strong>freedom</strong>. As much as they might like, the Governments of the world, in their public rhetoric at least, could not be completely oblivious to the ever-growing demands FOSS activists for the freedom [of software].</p>

<p>If we are diligent enough to embrace the history we can see that the main reason behind most of the revolutions is the freedom , irrespective of what the freedom is attributed to. For any revolution to be successful, it is important for the revolutionaries to create enablers and propagate the value that they are fighting for. They need to ensure that the people are convinced that the battle is worth fighting. And as long as this doesn’t happen the revolution will not gather much steam.</p>

<p>During a recent conversation with some of the well known FOSS activists from my region which included an entrepreneur and an academician the focus slowly shifted to the fact that the FOSS activity is not gaining the expected momentum in-spite of scores of volunteers are working towards the cause. The organisations associated with FOSS are undertaking numerous activities ranging from weekly sessions , creating new GLUGs (GNU / Linux Users Group) in colleagues to bi-annual sessions that cover from installation of any Linux flavour to ML.</p>

<p>One of the observations which all agreed to democratically was that, the focus of the volunteers in the recent past has shifted more towards teaching the technology which is in alignment with FOSS and how to technically contribute to any free software or open source software. A perhaps apocryphal notion has it that learning these technologies make one a geek or helps the student community to land at a better job or one among a plethora of reasons. Not getting into a mode of framing this into good, bad, right, wrong etc. I would like to reiterate that we are digressing from the core issues for which hundreds of thousands of FOSS activists are fighting for.</p>

<p>I believe that the central dogma of FOSS is all about the freedom , i.e. “Free software is software that gives you the user the freedom to share, study and modify it. We call this free software because the user is free” - FSF. I have to painstakingly mention that this very essence of freedom is not present in most of the students who demonstrate interest in being associated with FOSS organization in their local geographies ( at the very least where I am currently). I believe it is not too late for us to imbibe this value of freedom so that it can drive them towards appreciating free software for what it stands rather than the notion of being looked upon as a geek, causing an aridity in the revolution.</p>
